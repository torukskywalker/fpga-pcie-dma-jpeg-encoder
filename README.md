# Designing Your Own PCIe JPEG Encoder on FPGA

Here we're uploading some opensource files used in our FPGA PCIe DMA JPEG Encoder.
We built a hardware accelerator JPEG encoder with Opensource IP, Xilinx IP Flow on Boards.
We actullay now published a Eooks(current on kobo.com : Designing Your Own PCIe JPEG Encoder on FPGA) 
which is a Step by Step Hand-on Labs to shwo anyone who wants to learn and build PCIe JPEG Encoder on FPGA 
and Tested it with DMA Driver and C/C++ test program.

This is an introduction of a practical Ebook about how to design your own PCIe JPEG Encoder on FPGA 
as well as the C+++ software to control the FPGA design by PCIe, Driver and DMA.
